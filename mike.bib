For a system ofNparticles, an amount of work of the orderO(N2) has traditionally been required to evaluate all pairwise interactions, unless some approximation or truncation method is used. The algorithm of the present paper requires an amount of work proportional toNto evaluate all interactions to within roundoff error, making it considerably more practical for large-scale problems encountered in plasma physics, fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, and celestial mechanics.

abstract = "Abstract We address the conservation of angular momentum for cell-centered discretization of compressible fluid dynamics on general grids. We concentrate on the Lagrangian step which is also sufficient for Eulerian discretization using Lagrange+Remap. Starting from the conservative equation of the angular momentum, we show that a standard Riemann solver (a nodal one in our case) can easily be extended to update the new variable. This new variable allows to reconstruct all solid displacements in a cell, and is analogous to a partial Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization. We detail the coupling with a second-order Muscl extension. All numerical tests show the important enhancement of accuracy for rotation problems, and the reduction of mesh imprint for implosion problems. The generalization to axi-symmetric case is detailed. "

  abstract={In a canonical model, the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are accreting, nuclear-burning white dwarfs (NBWDs), which explode when the white dwarf reaches the Chandrasekhar mass, M C . Such massive NBWDs are hot ( kT ~ 100 eV), luminous ( L ~ 10 38 erg s –1 ), and are potentially observable as luminous supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs). During the past several years, surveys for soft X-ray sources in external galaxies have been conducted. This paper shows that the results falsify the hypothesis that a large fraction of progenitors are NBWDs which are presently observable as SSSs. The data also place limits on sub- M C models. While SN Ia progenitors may pass through one or more phases of SSS activity, these phases are far shorter than the time needed to accrete most of the matter that brings them close to M C .}

  abstract={We test a new "hybrid" scheme for simulating dynamical fluid flows in which cylindrical components of the momentum are advected across a rotating Cartesian coordinate mesh. This hybrid scheme allows us to conserve angular momentum to machine precision while capitalizing on the advantages offered by a Cartesian mesh, such as a straightforward implementation of mesh refinement. Our test focuses on measuring the real and imaginary parts of the eigenfrequency of unstable nonaxisymmetric modes that naturally arise in massless polytropic tori having a range of different aspect ratios and on quantifying the uncertainty in these measurements. Our measured eigenfrequencies show good agreement with the results obtained from the linear stability analysis of Kojima and from nonlinear hydrodynamic simulations performed on a cylindrical coordinate mesh by Woodward et al. When compared against results conducted with a traditional Cartesian advection scheme, the hybrid scheme achieves qualitative convergence at the same or, in some cases, much lower grid resolutions and conserves angular momentum to a much higher degree of precision. As a result, this hybrid scheme is much better suited for simulating astrophysical fluid flows such as accretion disks and mass-transferring binary systems.}

  abstract={We compare the nuclear energy generation rate and abundance levels given by an α-chain nuclear reaction network that contains only seven isotopes with a standard 13 isotope α-chain reaction network. The energy generation rate of these two small networks are also compared to the energy generation rate given by a 489 isotope reaction network with weak reactions turned on and off. The comparison between the seven isotope and α-chain reaction networks indicate the extent to which one can be replaced by the other, and the comparison with the 489 isotope reaction network roughly indicates under what physical conditions it is safe to use the seven isotope and α-chain reaction networks. The seven isotope reaction network reproduces the nuclear energy generation rate of the standard α-chain reaction network to within 30%, but often much better, during hydrostatic and explosive helium, carbon, and oxygen burning. It will also provide energy generation rates within 30% of an α-chain reaction network for silicon burning at densities less than 10 7 g cm -3 . Provided there remains an equal number of protons and neutrons ( Y e = 0.5) over the course of the evolution, and that flows through α-particle channels dominate, then both of the small reaction networks return energy generation rates that are compatible with the energy generation rate returned by the 489 reaction network. If Y e is significantly different from 0.5, or if there are substantial flows through neutron and protons channels, then it is not generally safe to employ any α-chain based reaction network. The relative accuracy of the seven isotope reaction network, combined with its reduction in the computational cost, suggest that it is a suitable replacement for α-chain reaction networks for parameter space surveys of a wide class of multidimensional stellar models.}

  abstract={We present three-dimensional simulations on a new mechanism for the detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar CO white dwarf in a dynamically unstable system where the secondary is either a pure He white dwarf or an He/CO hybrid. For dynamically unstable systems where the accretion stream directly impacts the surface of the primary, the final tens of orbits can have mass accretion rates that range from 10 –5 to 10 –3 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} s –1 , leading to the rapid accumulation of helium on the surface of the primary. After ~10 –2 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} of helium has been accreted, the ram pressure of the hot helium torus can deflect the accretion stream such that the stream no longer directly impacts the surface. The velocity difference between the stream and the torus produces shearing which seeds large-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities along the interface between the two regions. These instabilities eventually grow into dense knots of material that periodically strike the surface of the primary, adiabatically compressing the underlying helium torus. If the temperature of the compressed material is raised above a critical temperature, the timescale for triple-α reactions becomes comparable to the dynamical timescale, leading to the detonation of the primary's helium envelope. This detonation drives shock waves into the primary which tend to concentrate at one or more focal points within the primary's CO core. If a relatively small amount of mass is raised above a critical temperature and density at these focal points, the CO core may itself be detonated.}
